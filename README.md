PROJECT: Create a script that can read a list of names and ages from text file provided in this folder, and allow user to search for names and return their ages.

TO DO:
- Sort array alphabetically after reading it on (using bubble sort?)
- Make sure that all the values in array are lowercase.
- Ask user input to search for a name and returning age using binary search.
- Again, make sure that input is not case sensitive.
